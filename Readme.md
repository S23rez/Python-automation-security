## 🚀 Featured Tools

### 1. 🔍 Advanced Network Port Scanner
* **Purpose:** Rapidly identifies active services and open attack vectors on a target network.
* **Technical Highlights:** Developed using Python’s `socket` and `threading` libraries for high-performance concurrent scanning.
* **Security Use Case:** Essential for initial reconnaissance during penetration testing or network auditing.

### 2. 🕵️ OSINT Web Scraper
* **Purpose:** Automates the collection of publicly available data from targeted web domains.
* **Technical Highlights:** Built with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Features custom headers to handle anti-scraping measures.
* **Security Use Case:** Ideal for identifying information leaks, exposed employee data, or sensitive company updates.

### 3. 🏹 Subdomain Discovery Tool
* **Purpose:** Maps an organization’s external attack surface by discovering hidden subdomains.
* **Technical Highlights:** Uses automated brute-force techniques and dictionary lists to verify active HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.
* **Security Use Case:** Critical for finding unmonitored development servers or legacy staging environments.

### 4. 📂 System Workflow Automator
* **Purpose:** Organizes high-volume, messy directories (like Downloads) by file extension into categorized security bunkers.
* **Technical Highlights:** Utilizes `os` and `shutil` libraries for secure file handling and directory management.
* **Security Use Case:** Maintains a clean and organized digital workstation, ensuring sensitive logs and captures are never misplaced.

### 5. 🏗️ Iteration & Randomized Audit Simulator
* **Purpose:** Models a global, multi-region infrastructure scan to test security response logic.

* **Technical Highlights:** Implements nested for loops and random probability gates to simulate a 20% "Chaos" failure rate across London, USA, and China nodes.

* **Security Use Case:** Used for "Stress Testing" automation scripts to ensure they can handle multiple simultaneous device failures or randomized security breaches.


### 6. 🧹 Network Log (HAR) Sanitizer
* **Purpose:** Automatically redacts PII and sensitive session data from HTTP Archive (.har) files before they are shared for debugging.

* **Technical Highlights:**  Leverages Python's json and re libraries to bulk-process files, stripping Authorization headers and Cookies while masking email addresses.

* **Security Use Case:**Critical for Data Privacy Compliance and preventing accidental credential leakage during QA testing or security auditing.

### 7. 🛡️ Cisco Firewall & ACL Configurator
* **Purpose:** Automates the generation of firewall rules and Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Cisco network infrastructure.

* **Technical Highlights:**  Scripted logic for defining inbound/outbound rules and OSPF routing configurations.

* **Security Use Case:** Streamlines the hardening of network perimeters and ensures consistent security policies across routers.
